The Design System Working Group is a multidisciplinary panel of representatives from across the MoJ. It makes sure that all components and patterns published in the MoJ Design System are of a high quality and meet user needs.

The working group:

- reviews proposals and contributions against the [contribution criteria](/community/contribution-criteria/)
- makes recommendations to help contributors improve their work
- advocates for the needs of colleagues across the MoJ

## 1. Introduction
As part of the [Government Transformation Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-transformation-strategy-2017-to-2020/government-transformation-strategy#vision-and-objectives) the Government has committed to “build services that run seamlessly across government”.

To achieve this, teams need to work as efficiently as possible when designing and building government services.

They also need access to interaction and content design resources based on best practice from across government.

### MoJ Design System
To support this work, the Design Operations team at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has created the MoJ Design System. It contains guidance, examples, code and research that teams can use to help them prototype and build services.

Anyone can propose or develop new components or patterns for the [Design System](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/mojdt-design-system-backlog).

Enabling people from across the MoJ to contribute will ensure the Design System:

- represents user needs
- can scale quickly enough
- showcases best practice in the MoJ
- reduces duplication of effort

### Design System Working Group
The Design Operations team set up a working group which includes representatives from different disciplines and agencies across the MoJ.

The working group ensures components and patterns published in the Design System are of a high quality and meet user needs.

#### Benefits of joining the working group
Working group representatives contribute to the wider community by getting user-centred best practice into the Design System.

Supporting contribution to the Design System promotes collaboration across departments and supports the Digital Transformation Strategy.

For these reasons, joining the working group can be discussed as a community or corporate objective. This may help representatives to get the time and permission they need to participate.

## 2. Purpose of the working group
The working group supports contributions to the Design System by ensuring that components and patterns reflect the needs of:

- MoJ service users
- the wider MoJ community

### Principles of the working group
_These principles were co-created by the [GOV.UK Design System working group representatives in a workshop on 19 June 2018](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2019/02/14/how-the-gov-uk-design-system-can-work-alongside-other-government-design-resources/). To avoid confusion, they are also the guiding principles for the MoJ’s Design System working group._

#### Open by default

The working group is open, honest and transparent by default.

Working in the open and making honest recommendations help users understand past decisions and helps contributors improve their work.

#### Representative
Everybody has value to add.

The working group must be as representative as possible to help it:

- advocate for a range of user needs
- use the knowledge and experience of different disciplines and government departments

#### Community driven
The Design System can only meet the needs of the whole community if it’s built by the whole community.

The working group ensures that it’s community led, not MoJ Digital led.

#### Enablers, not blockers
The working group values getting contributions into the Design System over keeping them out.

They make constructive recommendations to help contributors improve their work.

## 3. Roles and responsibilities of the working group
Representatives of the working group are initially invited to participate for 3 months.

### Responsibilities of the working group
By joining the working group, representatives commit to support the Design System and help achieve its aims. They:

- review proposals and contributions against the Design System [contribution criteria](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/)
- collect input and feedback from their colleagues across government to inform their decisions
- ask contributors any questions they need to inform their decisions
- send their decisions on contributions to the Design Operations team before each review session
- attend a 1 hour long review session each month to discuss their decisions with contributors and the other representatives
- agree to have review session notes shared publicly, though they will not be named individually

### Responsibilities of the Design Operations team at MoJ Digital
The Design Operations team at MoJ Digital commits to support contributors and the working group. They:

- work with contributors to ensure their contribution is in the best shape possible before the working group review it
- ensure that any code meets [MoJ Frontend Coding Standards](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/tree/master/docs/contributing/coding-standards)
- organise and facilitate review sessions and make sure everyone gets a fair chance to speak
- record decisions publicly
- work with contributors to get components and patterns published in a timely manner after review sessions
- have ultimate responsibility to ensure the contents in the Design System adhere to relevant MoJ standards

Neither the Design Operations team nor the working group will overrule the other. If there is a disagreement, there will be processes in place to collect concerns and ensure a fair decision.

### Leaving the working group
After 3 months, representatives of the working group will be asked if they wish to continue for another 3 months or leave.

Some continuity and consistency in the working group helps things to run smoothly. Before joining, prospective representatives should consider if they can realistically commit to 3 months.

However, circumstances can change unexpectedly and absolutely no one will be made to feel bad if they have to leave before the end of 3 months.

Anyone wanting to leave should contact the Design Operations team who will organise a replacement.

## 4. Reviewing proposals and contributions

### Review sessions
Each month, the working group meets for 1 hour on Google Hangouts to discuss new proposals or contributions for the MoJ Design System. Contributors are invited to join the call.

The purpose of the session is for representatives to share their decisions and discuss questions, concerns or recommendations with each other and the contributors.

These sessions are booked a month in advance by the Design Operations team. The invitation to the session includes a link to join the Google Hangout as well as other important details.

Representatives who know they cannot attend a session should let the Design Operations team know as early as possible and send their decision and recommendations regardless.

During the review session, there will be note takers from the Design Operations team to record discussions, recommendations and decisions.

The Design System team will share these notes with the working group to check after each session.

To help Design System users understand how past decisions were made, the Design Operations team will publish a summary of the notes in GitHub. These will not mention individuals’ names.

### Reviewing new proposals
During a review session, representatives review each proposal against the contribution criteria, and vote on if it is [useful and unique](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/).

At this stage, representatives should base their decision on the idea for the component or pattern in question, not a possible implementation or any examples shown.

Proposals that meet these criteria can move into the ‘To-do’ column in the [community backlog](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/mojdt-design-system-backlog/projects/1), ready to be worked on and contributed.

When they have been fully researched and developed, contributions will be sent to the working group for a second review focusing on the implementation.

### Reviewing contributions before they are published
The Design Operations team will share contributions to review with the working group 2 weeks before each review session.

Representatives then have one week to review each contribution against the [contribution criteria for before a component or pattern is published](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/#before-publication).

They should consult with colleagues from their department and the wider community to inform their decision. As part of this, they should consider if there are any security, ethical or political implications for publishing the component or pattern.

Representatives can also use this time to ask the contributors any questions that will help them to reach a decision.

Based on this, they should decide if:

- the contribution can be published as it is
- the contribution cannot be published until certain recommendations have been addressed

Representatives should respond with their decisions one week before the review session.

During the review session, the facilitator will introduce each contribution and confirm the outcome of the vote. They will then go round each of the representatives one-by-one and ask them to talk through their decision.

Representatives will have the opportunity to ask the contributor any questions and the contributor will be able to respond and ask any questions in return.

At the end of the discussion, representatives will be asked if they’d like to change their initial answer, and the facilitator will confirm the final outcome.

### Publishing contributions
After the review session, the Design Operations team will work with the contributor to address any recommendations and get the contributions ready to publish.

Depending on the amount of work needed, it may take a few weeks to complete these steps.

If, during the course of addressing the working group’s recommendations, there are significant changes to the original contribution, it may be brought back to a future session for another review.

Once published, the Design Operations team will move the issue from ‘In progress’ to ‘Published’ in the community backlog, and will notify the working group.
