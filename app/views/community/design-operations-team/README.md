The Design Operations team exists to support the entire design profession with the tools and guidance they need to get their work done to the highest standards.

## 1. Introduction
As part of the [Government Transformation Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-transformation-strategy-2017-to-2020/government-transformation-strategy#vision-and-objectives) the Government has committed to “build services that run seamlessly across government”.

To achieve this, teams need to work as efficiently as possible when designing and building government services.

They also need access to interaction and content design resources based on best practice from across government.

### MOJ Design System & Frontend
To support this work, the Design Operations team has created the [MOJ Design System](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-design-system) and the [MOJ Frontend](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend). It contains guidance, examples, code and research that teams can use to prototype and build MOJ services.

Enabling people from across the MOJ to contribute will ensure the Design System:

- represents user needs
- can scale quickly enough
- showcases best practice in the MOJ
- reduces duplication of effort

The [MOJ Design System Backlog](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-design-system-backlog) exists to catalogue components and patterns used by the MOJ Digital community. The backlog is assessed by the [MOJ Design System Working Group](/community/design-system-working-group/) and components and patterns are prioritised for inclusion in the Design System.

Anyone can contribute a new component or pattern to the MOJ Design System. This is done by creating a new issue on the [MOJ Design System community backlog](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-design-system-backlog).

The MOJ Design System Working Group includes representatives from different disciplines and agencies across the MOJ.

The working group:

- ensures components and patterns published in the MOJ Design System are of a high quality and meet explicit user needs
- provides support to designers across MOJ in the use of components and patterns that are new or emerging
- supports designers in their contribution of components and patterns to the MOJ Design System community backlog.

The Design Operations team commits to support contributors and the Design System Working Group.

Design Operations will:

- work with contributors to ensure their contribution is in the best shape possible before the working group review it
- ensure that any code meets MOJ Frontend Coding Standards
- organise and facilitate review sessions and make sure everyone gets a fair chance to speak
- record decisions publicly
- work with contributors to get components and patterns published in a timely manner after review sessions
- have ultimate responsibility to ensure the contents in the Design System adhere to relevant MOJ standards

**The key goals of Design Operations are:**
1. Consistency – All designers in the MOJ Design Team working with the MOJ Design System, MOJ Design System community backlog and the MOJ Frontend
2. Culture – A Design Team culture of design reviews and design crits
3. Diversity – A diverse Design Team considering gender, ethnicity and status
