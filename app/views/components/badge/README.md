Use the badge to highlight small details. For example, when something is urgent or complete.

{{ dsExample({
  name: 'badge',
  example: 'default',
  height: 125
}) }}

## Guidance

### When to use this component

The badge is useful for drawing users attention to particular information. It should be used sparingly because when used a lot it loses its value.

<!-- ### When not to use this component -->



### How it works

There are 2 ways to use the badge component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

The default, neutral badge is blue. [Alternative styles](/styles/badge/) are also available, for example, green and red.

{{ dsExample({
  name: 'badge',
  example: 'complete',
  height: 125
}) }}

{{ dsExample({
  name: 'badge',
  example: 'urgent',
  height: 125
}) }}
