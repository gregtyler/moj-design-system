Use the header component for any service or system not hosted on GOV.UK such as those for the judiciary, legal professionals or staff.

Do not use this for citizen-facing services.

{{ dsExample({
  name: 'header',
  example: 'default',
  height: 150
}) }}

## Guidance

### How it works

There are 2 ways to use the header component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

The name of the organisation and service or system appears in the top left. You can also add global links in the top right. For example, "Profile" and "Sign out".
