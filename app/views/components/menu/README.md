  height: 175
}) }}

## Guidance

### When to use this component

Use this component when the there are a number of possible actions the user can take.

### When not to use this component

Don't use this component when a basic in-page form has multiple actions.

### How it works

By default this component just groups buttons together to ensure they are spaced correctly. But can be turned into a toggle menu at a configurable screen width that:

- is aligned right or left
- is coloured green (primary) or grey (secondary)

#### Left aligned grey toggle menu

Use the grey clour when it's not the main action the user needs to take.

{{ dsExample({
  name: 'menu',
  example: 'collapsible',
  height: 250
}) }}

#### Right aligned green toggle menu

Use the green colour when it's the main action the user needs to take.

{{ dsExample({
  name: 'menu',
  example: 'collapsible-alternative',
  height: 250
}) }}
