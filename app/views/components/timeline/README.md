Use the Timeline component to show a linear record of what’s happened.

{{ dsExample({
  name: 'timeline',
  example: 'default',
  height: 454
}) }}

## Guidance

### When to use this component

Use the timeline component when you need to let users know about the history of an item, such as a case or payment.

### When not to use this component

Don’t use the timeline component if you need to let users know where they are in a journey. In this case, you should use the [progress bar](/components/progress-bar/) component.

### How it works

There are 2 ways to use the badge component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

### Research on this component
