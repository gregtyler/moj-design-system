Help users upload one or more files.

## Upload a single file

There are 3 steps:

1. Select file
2. Upload file
3. Check file

## Upload multiple files

There are 4 steps:

1. Select file
2. Upload file
3. Check file
4. Add another file or continue

## How it works

Try not to ask users to upload filesâ€”it's a complex interaction.

You can change the contents of the pattern to suit your needs.

If the user uploaded an image you can show a preview on the check screen. The image can be full width.

If the user uploaded a spreadsheet, you can show users the data in a table.

If there are other fields on the first screen like a comment box, you can also show the answer on the check screen.

The file uploading works exactly the same with and without JavaScript.

When there's an error, use the GOV.UK Design System [Error Summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) and [Error Message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) components.

Use the [file input error messages](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/file-upload/#error-messages) from the GOV.UK Design System.

## Known gaps

These patterns are useful for infrequently used services or for users with low digital literacy.

We're working on an accessible bulk file upload pattern with drag and drop capability.

## Research on this pattern

The basis of these patterns have been used successfully at the Home Office. We have adopted and tweaked the patterns.

If you have used these patterns, get in touch to share your research findings.

## Contribute to this pattern

You can contribute to this pattern via the [design system backlog](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/mojdt-design-system-backlog/)
