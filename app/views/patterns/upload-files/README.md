## Known gaps

These patterns are useful for infrequently used services or for users with low digital literacy.

We're working on an accessible bulk file upload pattern with drag and drop capability.

## Research on this pattern

The basis of these patterns have been used successfully at the Home Office. We have adopted and tweaked the patterns.

If you have used these patterns, get in touch to share your research findings.

## Contribute to this pattern

You can contribute to this pattern via the [design system backlog](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/mojdt-design-system-backlog/)
